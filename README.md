# pngvideo -- Efficient png animations

**pngvideo** is a canvas-based animation player, based on PNGs. It provides the following over animated gifs:

* **Control over playback.** pngvideo loads all frames upfront so it will either play the animation properly, or it will wait. Additionally, you can start and stop playback.
* **Compression.** PNGs have much better compression than GIFs.
* **Alpha-channel** support.
* **Ease of assembly.** Creating an animated gif can be tricky. pngvideo just requires you to pass your frames to a python script which will do the rest.

pngvideo is also efficient, because it only sends the parts of the image that have changed.

WTFPL. Look it up if you care (I don't).

## Technical Details

A pngvideo has two components:

1. A JSON file describing dimensions, the length of each frame, etc.
2. A single tall PNG image of all frames. The frames should be delta-encoded: areas that do not change from the previous image are transparent. 

### Full frames

If there exists a pixel in the new frame for which

    pixel's alpha â‰  1
    and
    pixel's alpha != last full frame pixel's alpha

Then this frame should be marked as "isFull": true and should not be delta-encoded.
